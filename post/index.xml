          <description>&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;strong&gt;Good to Great in January 2016&lt;/strong&gt;. An awesome read sharing detailed analysis on how good companies became great. Although this book is about how companies became great but we could apply a lot of the learnings on ourselves. Concepts like level 5 leader, hedgehog concept, the stockdale paradox are equally applicable to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
